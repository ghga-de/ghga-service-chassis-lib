<!-- Please provide a short overview of the features of this service.-->

This repo is a template for creating a new microservice.

The directories, files, and their structure herein are recommendations
from the GHGA Dev Team.

### Naming Conventions
The github repository contains only lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens "-",
e.g.: `my-microservice`

The python package (and thus the source repository) contains underscores "_"
instead of hyphens, e.g.: `my_microservice`
However, an abbreviated version is prefered as package name.

### Adapt to your service
This is just a template and needs some adaption to your specific use case.

Please search for **"please adapt"** comments. They will indicate all locations
that need modification. Once the adaptions are in place, please remove these #
comments.

Finally, follow the instructions to generate the README.md described in
[`./readme_generation.md`](./readme_generation.md). Please also adapt this markdown file
by providing an overview of the feature of the package.
